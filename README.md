# News Site

The assignment was to create a "newspaper site" with heading including a logo and navbar, headline, news grid, all using a responsive design for various usage platforms.

## The problem

My main issue with this project has been time. Due to illness and work I've had to work a lot the last few days with this and the look is not what I would want.
I had to in the end focus on the content of the code and learning things instead of bothering about the layut, something I hope to learn more on as we go along.

What I had in my mind is not what was the product, however I guess that's also a good lesson and with experience perhaps one's ideas of what a good layout is will change too (and how to get there with faster means!)

The time-constraint also made me feel that the specifics of what we were to do was unclear, whether it was form over function or the other way around - I wouldn't for example call the start page of a news site a new site, but only the start page.
If the mission was indeed to create a fully operationel news site with working links to articles etc, then that's not what I've handed in (and the mockup does not define it either further than the start page)

Anyhow, the videos and practice-sessions gave a good start to work on the page, I wasn't aware of how little the videos actually were directed towards the "solution" of a final structure for a website and took far too much time looking thtough them to find the info I was sure I'd missed out on.

In the end I used, as was suggested a lot of search engines, like shecodes Athena, w3schools and others to get ahead as I couldn't really get help at q&as or in the slack (mainly because my questions were more broad than most people post there so far)

I was very happy when I put together the css grid and the responsive design, it felt like wins to get that in place in the end.

If I had more time, I would for sure make this page not look like it's from the end of the 90s or early 00s but bring it into the 20s!
I'd want sleeker borders and designlayout in general - but enough excuses!

My greatest takeaway from this is - I'll live.

## View it live

Netlify decided to block my account today without much warning, so I've done a copy and posted it to Github pages in the meantime.

Hopefully I'll soon be able to post the Netlify link and start the continous deployment of the page (I couldn't unfortunately figure out how to publish the news-site repository and had to make a copy).
